# **Runnig Python**
- Open folder
- use cmd as terminal instead of vs terminal becasue we will use software installed in window
- then create environment using anacoda which will run in cmd because it is installed in window
- One environment is enough for one project that may contain so many jupyter. change environment if you need different version of program
- we create environment to install program in this specific space instead of C derive to avoid conflicts
- then activate this environment
- connect kernel of jupyter with anaconda environment. #kernel helps to connect with environment and also run code
- Make new project and new environment

# **Loop**
- for loop
    - When to use: You use a for loop when you know the data in advance (e.g., a list, string, range) and want to perform an action on each element in that data.
    - Example: If you have a list of DNA nucleotides, and you want to print each nucleotide, you can use a for loop.

- While loop
    - When to use: You use a while loop when you don’t know the data limit in advance, but you want to cgit ontinue doing something as long as a certain condition is met. The loop will keep running and processing each element (or step) until the condition becomes False.
    - Example: If you wanted to process elements in a DNA sequence until you find a specific pattern (like a stop codon), you could use a while loop to continue until the condition is met.
